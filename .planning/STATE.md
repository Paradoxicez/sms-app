# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Developers can get a secure HLS playback URL for any registered camera via a single API call, and embed it on their website immediately.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-multi-tenant

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-multi-tenant) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Multi-tenant RLS established in Phase 1 -- retrofitting is painful, all subsequent phases build on org isolation
- [Roadmap]: SRS integration (Phase 2) is highest-risk -- proven early before features build on top
- [Roadmap]: External FFmpeg process pool (not SRS built-in ingest) -- dynamic camera management without config reload
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5, 6, 7 depend only on Phase 2, enabling parallelization after core pipeline is stable
- [Phase 01]: Prisma 6 instead of 7 due to Node 22.11 < 22.12 requirement
- [Phase 01]: Vitest 3 instead of 4 due to ESM incompatibility with Node 22.11
- [Phase 01]: Docker Compose ports remapped (5434:5432, 6380:6379) to avoid local service conflicts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SRS single-process architecture may hit CPU limits at 50-100 cameras (Pitfall 1) -- Phase 6 addresses scaling
- H.265 cameras require transcoding for browser playback -- must be handled in Phase 2 stream profiles
- Recording storage grows fast (~42 GB/day per 1080p camera) -- Phase 7 must include retention enforcement
